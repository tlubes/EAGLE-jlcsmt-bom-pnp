# EAGLE-jlcsmt-bom-pnp
Creates the required pnp and bom files for JLCSMT assembly service from an EAGLE board

Just a simple approach to use the JLCSMT assembly service with your EAGLE project, since the files generated by EAGLE did not work directly.
I chose python for the csv generation, since I want to do some more cleanup to the values from EAGLE in the future and eventually pick the right part from the LCSC part library (supported by JLCSMT).

## Prerequisites
Adjust the absolute paths on top of the main.py and the jlcsmt-bom-pnp.ulp file to make it work with you system
